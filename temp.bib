abstract = {Environmental uncertainty and hyperconnectivity force techno-socio-economic systems to introspect and adapt to succeed and survive. The current practice is primarily intuition-driven, which is inconsistent with the need for precision and rigor. The concept of digital twins is rapidly emerging as an experimentation aid to help: (i) understand why a system is the way it is, (ii) prepare for possible outlier conditions; and (iii) identify plausible solutions for mitigating the outlier conditions in an evidence-backed manner. However, its effective use is limited to physical and cyber-physical systems that are governed by well-established laws and operate in environments that are relatively static or that evolve slowly. This workshop brings together leading researchers and practitioners from various fields and from different parts of the world to explore the challenges involved in effectively using digital twin technologies for techno-socio-economic systems, and to exchange ideas, concepts, approaches that aim to address those challenges.},

abstract = {It is always uncertain to know when your favorite farm produce will be arriving on the shelves when you cannot find one at the grocery store. Most consumers simply return home and come back to the grocery store at a future date/time in anticipation that they will find the produce. However, there is no guarantee that on their return, the produce will have arrived in the store or be available on the shelves. These events can lead to disappointments, wasted travel time and effort, and cost. The goal of this paper is to enable farm produce consumers to track the location, distribution, and time when their produce will be arriving at the grocery store via a mobile application. However, there are challenges to address such as not disclosing the actual location of drivers/distributors to the public due to safety and privacy concerns. Thus, we adopted digital twin (i.e., virtual replicas of the actual location data) techniques to enhance data confidentiality. The mobile application is a distributed architecture with a cloud-based middleware server and a database. The preliminary testing of the work shows that consumers are happy with the mobile application, and the system evaluation also confirms the feasibility of deploying such a mobile product.},

abstract = {The growing maturity of Digital Twin (DT) technology represents a quantum leap towards the realisation of Industry 4.0 and beyond. DT refers to virtual representations (in a virtual space) of physical objects/processes/systems (in a physical space), where information is regularly exchanged between them to enable real-time remote control and monitoring. DT will significantly improve product life-cycles and will transform industries such as smart manufacturing, smart transportation, and so forth. Digital Twin Networks (DTNs) are envisaged to be the norm where multiple DTs are logically connected to their respective physical objects, forming a many-to-many communication relationship. Strict real-time communication for bi-directional data flows is required in DTNs for DTs to accurately reflect the changes in the physical objects, and vice-versa. One potential candidate to achieve real-time data transmission is Time Sensitive Networking (TSN). The IEEE 802.1Q working group has developed a set of TSN standards to facilitate data transmissions that require low-latency, high availability and reliability. In TSN, the Central Network Controller (CNC) computes the schedule of frame transmission. However, the computational time required can exponentially increase as the number of nodes and data flows increases (already typical in industrial environments and will increase exponentially with DTNs). In this paper, we propose a novel technique using multi-level graph partitioning theory with Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to facilitate TSN scheduling. Our results demonstrated significant improvements in computational time and the success rate of scheduled data flows in complex networks where there are up to 100 nodes and 350 data flows.},

abstract = {Precision agriculture and aquaculture offer a new way of creating a production system that is efficient and eco-friendly with the potential to increase food availability to wider communities across the globe. Digital technologies and applied computing play a crucial role to aid local farmers in better control of production losses. This paper addresses whether it is feasible to deploy a virtual digital replica of aquaculture farms to control essential water quality variables, including temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, turbidity and ammonia. Traditional IoT systems can offer monitoring capabilities. However, this emerging application requires real-time control-based actuation to intervene in the environment. Often, farmers have limited time to react to any anomalous event. The proposed Planetary Digital Twin employs AI-based control loops to monitor, simulate and optimize aquaculture processes and assets. Preliminary system validation results suggest the approach is feasible in communicating real-time sensor data to a mechanism to detect and control anomalies.},

abstract = {Clinical trial digital twins are virtual patients that reflect personal characteristics in a high degree of granularity and can be used to simulate various patient outcomes under different conditions. With the growth of clinical trial databases captured by Electronic Data Capture (EDC) systems, there is a growing interest in using machine learning models to generate digital twins. This can benefit the drug development process by reducing the sample size required for participant recruitment, improving patient outcome predictive modeling, and mitigating privacy risks when sharing synthetic clinical trial data. However, prior research has mainly focused on generating Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs), which often assume large training data and do not account for personalized synthetic patient record generation. In this paper, we propose a sample-efficient method TWIN for generating personalized clinical trial digital twins. TWIN can produce digital twins of patient-level clinical trial records with high fidelity to the targeting participant's record and preserves the temporal relations across visits and events. We compare our method with various baselines for generating real-world patient-level clinical trial data. The results show that TWIN generates synthetic trial data with high fidelity to facilitate patient outcome predictions in low-data scenarios and strong privacy protection against real patients from the trials.},

We propose a systemic model of Digital Twin (DT), where HDT is a specific class of DT. The last years of literature on HDT are reviewed, to build a generic definition, extract the main components and integrate them in a generic systemic model centred on the DT and HDT concepts as systems. Doing this, we make explicit the link between DT and the systems they twin, including the special system that is the human-being, when a DT becomes a HDT.},

The demand for real-time decision-making in the manufacturing industry has given significant attention to the field of Digital Twin (DT).

Based on that, this paper proposes a simulation-optimization framework for the DT model of a Beverage Manufacturing Plant. A data-driven simulation model developed in Simio is integrated with Python to perform Multi-Objective optimization. The framework explores optimal solutions by simulating multiple scenarios by altering the availability of operators and dispatching/scheduling rules. The results show that simulation optimization can be integrated into the Digital-Twin models as part of real-time production planning and scheduling.},

abstract = {Individuals who experience motor impairment after stroke are able to partially restore motor control through rehabilitation, which achieves long-term recovery through repeated short-term adaptation. The customization of rehabilitation tasks is crucial for enhancing the effectiveness of rehabilitation by promoting the patient's awareness of motor impairments and reducing compensatory behaviors, which is currently dependent on the expertise of physiotherapists. The development of rehabilitation robots aims to alleviate the workload of physiotherapists and has the potential to offer accurate assessments of both short-term adaptation and long-term recovery in stroke patients. In this paper, we propose a framework for automated patient evaluation and task planning during robotic rehabilitation. A motor control model was proposed to capture the patient's motor control process. By adjusting its state and parameters, a digital twin of the patient can be generated and updated, providing insight into the level of adaptation and rehabilitation progress. The digital twin is then utilized to plan customized rehabilitation tasks, which can effectively reduce uncertainty and ambiguities during patient evaluation, and improves patient's adaptation during rehabilitation. The digital twin framework and the task planning algorithms were validated using human subject and simulation experiments.},

We introduce three explainability scores to measure the value of explainable modeling.

abstract = {Digital twins are virtual models for representing, monitoring, and controlling real-world products, entities, and processes, and are fundamental for enabling digitalization and continuous engineering processes. The usage of digital twins for engineering software-intensive systems will significantly change current business models, development approaches, and technologies. In this regard, the application scenarios and starting conditions for companies to introduce digital twins are manifold depending on their experience in software and system engineering, the maturity of their development processes, and the strategic management support and motivation. This article describes (i) challenges and impacts on the system development activities and architecture design approaches that are caused by the introduction and exploitation of digital twins, and also (ii) proposals for tailoring and extending traditional architecture-centric engineering processes to consider digital twin concepts.},

abstract = {Hybrid clouds bring together the advantages of the on-premises, private, and public cloud services. Agility, privacy, and regulatory compliance are some of the advantages of hybrid clouds. However, the key characteristics of complex hybrid cloud application such as heterogeneity, reliability, interoperability, scalability, and dynamic nature also makes old static approaches brittle. A digital twin can capture real-time (meta) data of a hybrid cloud application and supply valuable insights for efficient management of the cloud services and analyzing faults. In this paper, we propose a digital twin assisted approach to analyze the faults, interoperability, and reliability issues of a hybrid cloud-based application. We also present some metamorphic relations to analyze the reliability of our twin. Insights from the digital twin can assist developers to take proactive measures before a fault occur. The digital twin can also help detect faults and identify the cause and remediation steps through data insights. The key advantage of using digital twin is that it helps detect issues in complex hybrid cloud applications in a holistic way.},

At the same time, the inherent safety and privacy risks associated with drone-based applications call for appropriate testing and monitoring tools. In this paper, we present a simulation environment and digital twin support for a platform that allows the managed execution of drone-based applications on top of a shared drone infrastructure. On the one hand, the simulation environment makes it possible to perform a wide range of tests regarding the operation of both the platform itself and the applications that run on top of it, before deploying them in the real world. On the other hand, after deployment, a digital twin of the drone is used to detect deviations of the application from the expected behavior, which, in turn, can serve as an indication of bugs that remained undetected during the simulation tests or malfunctions that occur at runtime. We discuss the most important elements of our approach and the simulation and digital twin components of the proposed system. Also, we provide a functional evaluation of our work by presenting its capabilities regarding both offline testing and runtime checking through indicative use cases.},

abstract = {Global competition forces assembly, production, and logistic systems to be highly efficient and agile. Such complex systems deliver their functionality through dynamic interactions between their individual elements, which cannot be captured by analytical methods. To evaluate the impact of design decisions on system performance and validate a design alternative, it is necessary to use methods such as simulation that can replicate that dynamic behavior. The digital twin in industry 4.0 aims to replicate a system's characteristics and behavior. However, that has been mostly used for performance monitoring and control of a manufacturing system at the operation stage. This paper introduced an approach to develop an experimentable digital twin of a manufacturing system that can be used for virtual validation of a design alternative and analyzing the impact of design decisions on overall system performance as a function of dynamic interactions. The introduced approach constructs the system architecture of a manufacturing system by orchestrating systems engineering, object-oriented and finite state machine methods such that the developed Meta-model allows simulation of various alternatives and can be used later at the operation stage for smart manufacturing purposes. Therefore, the digital twin replicates the manufacturing system in its lifecycle from when it is a design concept to the stage that it is constructed physically.},

This paper presents a series of use cases that illustrate the role of a digital twin in different stages of the industrial product lifecycle.

abstract = {Digital twins emerge in many disciplines to support engineering, monitoring, controlling, and optimizing cyber-physical systems, such as airplanes, cars, factories, medical devices, or ships. There is an increasing demand to create digital twins as representation of cyber-physical systems and their related models, data traces, aggregated data, and services. Despite a plethora of digital twin applications, there are very few systematic methods to facilitate the modeling of digital twins for a given cyber-physical system. Existing methods focus only on the construction of specific digital twin models and do not consider the integration of these models with the observed cyber-physical system. To mitigate this, we present a fully model-driven method to describe the software of the cyber-physical system, its digital twin information system, and their integration. The integration method relies on MontiArc models of the cyber-physical system's architecture and on UML/P class diagrams from which the digital twin information system is generated. We show the practical application and feasibility of our method on an IoT case study. Explicitly modeling the integration of digital twins and cyber-physical systems eliminates repetitive programming activities and can foster the systematic engineering of digital twins.},

The developed model of the digital twin of plants must meet the following requirements: real-time environmental data acquisition, user feedback collection, continuous adaptation of the plant development plan for each event, individual instance for field or field part. The digital twin of plant is designed as an intelligent cyber-physical system that has a user-defined knowledge bas and a multi-agent system for planning and modeling of plant growth and development, as well as for forecasting crop parameters. For this purpose, a new method for estimate stage duration and yield is proposed, which defines a "tube" – a corridor to each of the factors corresponding plant development. The key factors have been determined during consultations with practicing agronomists but can be adjusted by users experience. This concept was originally introduced for wheat digital twin, but now is scaled and modified to simulate broccoli growth process.},

These specifications are formalized into a hierarchy of assume-guarantee contracts. Each contract specifies a set of temporal behaviors, characterizing the different machines composing the production line, their actions and interaction. Then, the formal specifications provided by the contracts are systematically synthesized to automatically generate a digital twin for the production line. Finally, the digital twin is used to evaluate, and validate, both the functional and the extra-functional characteristics of the system.The methodology has been applied to validate the production of a product requiring additive manufacturing, robotic assembling and transportation.},

abstract = {While industrial environments are increasingly equipped with sensors and integrated to enterprise networks, current security strategies are generally not prepared for the growing attack surface that resides from the convergence of their IT infrastructure with the industrial systems. As a result, the organizations responsible for corporate security, the Security Operations Center (SOC), are overwhelmed with the integration of the industrial systems.To facilitate monitoring the industrial assets, digital twins represent a helpful novel concept. They are the virtual counterparts of such assets and provide valuable insights through collecting asset-centric data, analytic capabilities and simulations. Moreover, digital twins can assist enterprise security by simulating attacks and analyzing the effect on the virtual counterpart. However, the integration of digital twin security simulations into enterprise security strategies, that are mainly controlled by the SOC, is currently neglected.To close this research gap, this work develops a process-based security framework to incorporate digital twin security simulations in the SOC. In the course of this work, a use case along with a digital twin-based security simulation provides proof of concept. It is demonstrated how a man-in-the-middle attack can be performed in a simulated industry setting and how it affects the systems. Moreover, we show how the resulting system logs can support the SOC by building technical rules to implement in Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.},

abstract = {In recent years, the digital twin has been one of the active research areas in modern Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Both the digital twin and its physical counterpart, called a plant, are highly intertwined such that they continuously exchange data to reveal useful information about the overall system. Such class of CPSs need to be robust to various types of disturbances, such as faulty sensors and model discrepancies, since the interplay between the physical plant's operation and digital twin's simulation may lead to undesirable or even destructive effect. To address this problem, this paper introduces a flexible anomaly detection framework for monitoring anomalous behaviours in digital twin based CPSs. In particular, our approach integrates both the digital twin and data-driven techniques that detect and classify anomalous behaviours due to modelling errors (e.g. incomplete models) and sensor and physical system's faults. The framework can be deployed to any general CPSs without the full knowledge of the digital twin's internal model. Therefore, our method is amenable to various types of digital twin implementations that enhance the traditional data-driven anomaly detection mechanism. We demonstrate the performance of our approach using the Tennessee Eastman Process model. The experimental result shows our approach is able to effectively detect and classify anomaly sources from the physical plant, sensor and digital twin, even in the situation when a certain combination of multiple anomalies occur simultaneously.},

In this paper, we investigate two spatial awareness visualizations to enable joint exploration of a space for dyads consisting of a smartphone AR user and a head-mounted display VR user. Our study revealed that both, a mini-map-based method and an egocentric compass method with a path visualization, enabled the on-site visitors to locate and follow a virtual companion reliably and quickly. Furthermore, the embodiment of the AR user by an inverse kinematics avatar allowed the use of natural gestures such as pointing and waving which was preferred over text messages by the participants of our study. In an expert review in a museum and its digital twin we observed an overall high social presence for on-site AR and remote VR visitors and found that the visualizations and the avatar embodiment successfully facilitated their communication and collaboration.},

abstract = {Anomaly detection is critical to ensure the security of cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, due to the increasing complexity of attacks and CPS themselves, anomaly detection in CPS is becoming more and more challenging. In our previous work, we proposed a digital twin-based anomaly detection method, called ATTAIN, which takes advantage of both historical and real-time data of CPS. However, such data vary significantly in terms of difficulty. Therefore, similar to human learning processes, deep learning models (e.g., ATTAIN) can benefit from an easy-to-difficult curriculum. To this end, in this paper, we present a novel approach, named digitaL twin-based Anomaly deTecTion wIth Curriculum lEarning (LATTICE), which extends ATTAIN by introducing curriculum learning to optimize its learning paradigm. LATTICE attributes each sample with a difficulty score, before being fed into a training scheduler. The training scheduler samples batches of training data based on these difficulty scores such that learning from easy to difficult data can be performed. To evaluate LATTICE, we use five publicly available datasets collected from five real-world CPS testbeds. We compare LATTICE with ATTAIN and two other state-of-the-art anomaly detectors. Evaluation results show that LATTICE outperforms the three baselines and ATTAIN by 0.906\%-2.367\% in terms of the F1 score. LATTICE also, on average, reduces the training time of ATTAIN by 4.2\% on the five datasets and is on par with the baselines in terms of detection delay time.},

abstract = {Autonomy has been touted to be a major asset of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and its components. By intertwining non-physical and physical processes they seamlessly integrate interdependent computational and physical components. In this contribution we take a closer look on structural constellations of CPS and their components that refer to autonomy. We also take into account development aspects and demonstrate encoding autonomy aspects into a behavior-centered representation scheme for digital twins. It features encapsulation on various layers of abstraction in the course of design and choreography for self-contained while networked operation of CPS as System-of-Systems. As digital twin models created in the course of CPS design activities can be executed automatically, the implementation and adaptation of CPS (components) is intertwined with design activities. Consequently, users can act as designers and experience CPS behavior through digital twin execution interactively. Critical elements, such as managing private data in healthcare, can be monitored and adapted to individual needs.},

abstract = {The manufacturing industry is gradually reforming in the direction of intelligent digitalization. The traditional automation control technology and virtual simulation technology cannot intuitively reflect the operation working state of the actual equipment in the intelligent manufacturing production line in order to solve the problems of low intelligence level, lack of 3D visualization function, and poor sense of interactive experience in the traditional manufacturing system. In this paper, we design a digital twin intelligent control training system based on digital twin technology and determine the overall framework of the system and the corresponding modules and functions. The static virtual model of the twin system is constructed using 3dMAX software, the UI visualization of the dynamic interactive twin system is built using the unity development platform, and the OPC UA based industrial IoT real-time data acquisition method is proposed. The digital twin module establishes the data acquisition framework to connect the actual production line with the virtual production line to realize real-time data signal acquisition and control and complete the digital twin and data fusion. The experimental results show that the system can realize intelligent control of production line visualization production and intuitively reflect the operation status of the equipment. The system is used to teach practical training courses in colleges and universities. Students can obtain the real-time operation status of production plants in the physical world through the models, movements, data, and other information displayed by the digital twin, which increases students' practical operation ability and improves the teaching effect, and lays the foundation for further expanding the application fields of digital twin technology.},

abstract = {Knowing "what is happening" and "what will happen" of the mobility in a city is the building block of a data-driven smart city system. In recent years, mobility digital twin that makes a virtual replication of human mobility and predicting or simulating the fine-grained movements of the subjects in a virtual space at a metropolitan scale in near real-time has shown its great potential in modern urban intelligent systems. However, few studies have provided practical solutions. The main difficulties are four-folds: 1) the daily variation of human mobility is hard to model and predict; 2) the transportation network enforces a complex constraints on human mobility; 3) generating a rational fine-grained human trajectory is challenging for existing machine learning models; and 4) making a fine-grained prediction incurs high computational costs, which is challenging for an online system. Bearing these difficulties in mind, in this paper we propose a two-stage human mobility predictor that stratifies the coarse and fine-grained level predictions. In the first stage, to encode the daily variation of human mobility at a metropolitan level, we automatically extract citywide mobility trends as crowd contexts and predict long-term and long-distance movements at a coarse level. In the second stage, the coarse predictions are resolved to a fine-grained level via a probabilistic trajectory retrieval method, which offloads most of the heavy computations to the offline phase. We tested our method using a real-world mobile phone GPS dataset in the Kanto area in Japan, and achieved good prediction accuracy and a time efficiency of about 2 min in predicting future 1h movements of about 220K mobile phone users on a single machine to support more higher-level analysis of mobility prediction.},

The development of tools that aid in integrating real-world physical systems with digital capabilities is essential for advancing digital twin technology. In this work, we present one such digital twin tool that integrates the longitudinal thermal envelope data of buildings on the campus of the National University of Singapore with a virtual 3D model. Thermal images of the buildings were captured using a neighborhood-scale infrared observatory for a few months. The temperature profile of one of the buildings was extracted and mapped on the virtual 3D model. The digital twin model is developed in the deck.gl platform. This is one of the few studies on developing a dynamic digital twin incorporating temporally and spatially varying urban-scale 2D temperature envelope data with the virtual 3D model. The digital twin platform can study the microclimate and help urban planners identify the building elements contributing to the urban heat island (UHI) effect at the neighborhood scale.},
